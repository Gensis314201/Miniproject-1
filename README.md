# Miniproject for Calender in Two Languages Kannada and English


This project prints out the calendar of a user desired year, it will use the formual to calcualte the leap year and to find out which day of the week does the day 0 start on a given year.

The formula to calculate leap year was not created by me, instead I used this website: https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html
